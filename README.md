# Round_Robin
Operating System Process Scheduling algorithims.

Sudesh being a Linux expert is a person approached by many of students and teachers for their various queries but he has fixed amount of time that he can dedicate for the same .So he decide 2 hours from 10.00  to 12.00 for the same .Within the same time limits he wants to reach each and every queries . So for the same he wants a system which pre-empts after fixed quanta of time so that he can reach to each and everyoneâ€™s query so we are required to implement a system for the Sudesh. An algorithm which takes multiple queries and schedule them in a manner that fixed time is given to each query and pre-empted to the next one and execute each one of them . This is what the definition of Round Robin scheduling algorithm is so the system  can be implemented using the Round Robin algorithm. It is one of the pre-emptive process scheduling algorithm in which processes are executed for fixed quanta of time. It uses context switching to save state of pre-empted process so it can revert back to it.

Advantages of Round Rodin Scheduling is that Each and Every process gets opportunity to run starvation which is never occurred in Round Rodin Scheduling.
